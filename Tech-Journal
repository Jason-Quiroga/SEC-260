Class Notes
I. HTTP
  A. TCP
    1. In TCP, you need the IP address of the server computer and the TCP port number associated with the specific software program running on the server.
  B. Web Resources
    1. Static file on the web server's file system can contain anything: Text, HTML files, microsoft word files, etc.
    2. Dynamic content resources can generate content, for example: Based on your identity, time of day, live image from camera, etc.
  C. URI --> Can retrieve an object from a server
  D. URL
    1. Tells precisely where a resource is located and how to access it.
    2. Example: http://www.joeshardware.com/specials
      a. "http://" --> Use HTTP protocol
      b. "www.joeshardware.com" --> Go to joeshardware.com
      c. "/specials" --> Grab the resource called /specials
    3. The first part of the URL is called the scheme, and it describes the protocol used to access the resource (usually the HTTP protocol)
    4. The second part gives the server internet address (www.joeshardware.com)
    5. The rest names a resource on the web server (/special)
    6. Today, almost every URI is a URL
  E. Relative Paths
    1. Only point to a file or a file path
      a. index.html
      b. /graphics/image.png
    2. When a user clicks  arelative link, the browser takes them to that location on the current site
    3. <a href="linkhere.html">Click Me</a>
  F. Absolute Paths
    1. Hard coded, long form, no shortcut path to a resource
    2. Always include the domain name of the website, including http://
      a. http://www.mysite.com
      b. http://www.mysite.com/graphics/image.png
    3. If we had a site called http://www.website.com and a subfolder called pictures and inside pictures is pictures.html, the URL would be:
      a. http://www.website.com/pictures/pictures.html
      b. And in this pictures.html file, we have a link
        1. <a href="morepictures.html">More Pictures</a>
      c. Which would go to httpL//www.website.com/pictures/morepictures.html

      a. Begins with <html> and ends with </html>
    5. Elements (tags) are nested one inside another: <html> <head> </head> <body> </body> </html>
    6. Tags have attributes: <img src="logo.jpg" alt="logo"/> *Note that the close is INSIDE of the tag for image tags
    7. HTML source code should be formatted to increase readability and facilitate debugging
    8. HTML EXAMPLE:
