--> PFSENSE:
- Username: admin
- Password: pfsense

II. How to configure AD01 through commandline
  A. Log on and enter a new password when prompted
  B. Use the command "sconfig" and change the settings to the following:
    1. IP: 10.0.5.5
    2. Netmask: 255.255.255.0
    3. Gateway: 10.0.5.2
    4. Prefered DNS: 10.0.5.2
    5. Computer name: ad01-jason
    6. Manual Windows Update
  C. Restart when prompted for computer name
  D. Now, invoke powershell (using the command "powershell")
  E. Install AD by typing "Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services -IncludeManagementTools
  F. Install the Forest with the command "Install-ADDSForest -DomainName jason.local" and enter password when prompted
  G. After installation is complete, if you type "whoami", it should return "jason/administrator"
III. How to join a domain through powershell
  A. Open up a command prompt with administrator privileges
  B. Invoke powershell with "powershell" command
  C. Type in the command " add-computer -domainname "jason" -restart " and then type in the username and password of a Domain Administrator (for me, this was a default
  on the AD01 server, so the username was "Administrator" and the password was what I set it to when I configured it first).
  D. Your workstation will restart after implementing the domain change and you should now be a part of the domain.
  

Class Notes
I. HTTP
  A. TCP
    1. In TCP, you need the IP address of the server computer and the TCP port number associated with the specific software program running on the server.
  B. Web Resources
    1. Static file on the web server's file system can contain anything: Text, HTML files, microsoft word files, etc.
    2. Dynamic content resources can generate content, for example: Based on your identity, time of day, live image from camera, etc.
  C. URI --> Can retrieve an object from a server
  D. URL
    1. Tells precisely where a resource is located and how to access it.
    2. Example: http://www.joeshardware.com/specials
      a. "http://" --> Use HTTP protocol
      b. "www.joeshardware.com" --> Go to joeshardware.com
      c. "/specials" --> Grab the resource called /specials
    3. The first part of the URL is called the scheme, and it describes the protocol used to access the resource (usually the HTTP protocol)
    4. The second part gives the server internet address (www.joeshardware.com)
    5. The rest names a resource on the web server (/special)
    6. Today, almost every URI is a URL
  E. Relative Paths
    1. Only point to a file or a file path
      a. index.html
      b. /graphics/image.png
    2. When a user clicks  arelative link, the browser takes them to that location on the current site
    3. <a href="linkhere.html">Click Me</a>
  F. Absolute Paths
    1. Hard coded, long form, no shortcut path to a resource
    2. Always include the domain name of the website, including http://
      a. http://www.mysite.com
      b. http://www.mysite.com/graphics/image.png
    3. If we had a site called http://www.website.com and a subfolder called pictures and inside pictures is pictures.html, the URL would be:
      a. http://www.website.com/pictures/pictures.html
      b. And in this pictures.html file, we have a link
        1. <a href="morepictures.html">More Pictures</a>
      c. Which would go to httpL//www.website.com/pictures/morepictures.html

I. Web Page
  A. Static Web Pages are text files containing HTML
    1. HTML --> Hyper Text Markup Language
  B. HTML is the most basic bulding block of the Web. It describes and defines the content of the webpage.
    1. Hypertext refers to links that connect webpages to one another
    2. Markup means to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a web browser.
      a. Markup includes special elements, such as <head>, <title>, <body>, etc.
    3. Basic html always has an opening and a closing
      a. IE. <html> </html>
      a. <html> --> oepning tag for document
      b. <head> --> section not displayed but contains info for the browser
      c. <title> --> The name of the page that is printed on the tab THIS IS WHERE THE TITLE GOES
      d. </title> --> close title
      e. </head> close head
      f. <body> --> Contains what is displayed in the browser
      g. </body> close body
      h. </html> close html, end of document
    4. HTML is comprised of elements and tags
      a. Begins with <html> and ends with </html>
    5. Elements (tags) are nested one inside another: <html> <head> </head> <body> </body> </html>
    6. Tags have attributes: <img src="logo.jpg" alt="logo"/> *Note that the close is INSIDE of the tag for image tags
    7. HTML source code should be formatted to increase readability and facilitate debugging
    8. HTML EXAMPLE:
    
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is some text...</p>
  </body>
</html>

  C. Simple Tags

    2. Image Tags

  D. Headings and Paragraphs
    1. Heading Tags (h1 - h6)
      a. <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    2. Paragraph Tags
      a. <p>This is my first paragraph</p>
    3. Sections: div and span
      a. <div style="background:blue" This is a div</div>
  E. Using VI
    1. Unix-based text editor
    2. **Help sheet posted in a lab
    3. Default editor used in most Linux installs
    4. Two modes - look at the bottom left to see your mode:
      a. INSERT: type "i" and you can edit the file, use arrow keys to navigate
      b. COMMAND: Hit esc key and then ":" to enter commands
        I. :w writes (saves) file
        II. :wq writes and quits file
        III. :q! quits without saving
